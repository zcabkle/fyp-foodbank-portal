# Testing 

Testing was done with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).<br>
There is one test suite for pages and another for components.<br>

To run the tests run `npm run test`. <br>
To run tests with coverage run `npm test -- --coverage`.

More information around running and configuring tests can be count on the [Create-React-App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/)
